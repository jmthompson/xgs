TO-DO LIST
----------

o Win32 port needs support for keypad keys. Somehow they need to be detected
  and filtered so that they remain as WM_KEYDOWN messages; the current code
  will turn them into WM_CHAR messages and all information about the keys
  being keypad keys will be lost.
o There's a hard lockup somewhere in the sound code; it must be found and
  fixed.
o Faster sound code would be nice.
o Implement writing to .NIB images.
o Make a real user interface. It should have at least the following features:
	- controls for loading/unloading images at runtime
	- drive lights based on the motor_on variables in iwm.c
	- Speed readout moved out of main window
	- Speed controls
o Rewrite adb.c to support emulation of the actual ADB keyboard and mouse
  hardware for programs that use the ADB directly, such as Wolf3D.
o Serial port emulation
o Finish the SVGAlib port
o Put xgs.ram into $HOME/.xgs
o Run-time configuration file, probably a global file that can be overriden
  by a file in the user's home directory.
