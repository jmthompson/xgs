The XGS Porting Guide

Please read this if you are interested in doing a port of XGS to a currently
unsupported platform.

Before starting any porting work, it's best to check with me first. This lets
me keep track of who is doing what and make sure that nobody wastes effort by
doing the same thing that somebody else is already working on.

The next step is the hardest part: actually doing the port. This should not
be _too_ difficult, as XGS is written to be portable and most of the code in
the main distribution will compile on any decent ANSI C compiler with no
modification whatsoever. In fact, your port will probably consist of the
following components:

o A video output driver (vid-drv.c and vid-drv.h)		[ required ]
o An input driver (adb-drv.c and adb-drv.h)			[ required ]
o A sound output driver (snd-drv.c and snd-drv.h)		[ optional ]

Drivers for specific ports are stored in subdirectories in the arch/
directory of the main source tree. If you need to make any patches outside
of arch/, please try to keep them to an absolute minimum, make sure they
don't break any other ports (use #ifdef's to bracket your changes if you
must),  and submit them to me for integration into the main source tree.

Since XGS was originally written for X11 and Open Sound System, those ports
are a good place from which to start your port. Once your port is completed,
you can send me your drivers for inclusion into the arch/ directory of the
main XGS distribution.
