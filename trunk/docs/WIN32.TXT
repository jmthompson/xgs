You will need to have DirectX 2 installed in order to use this
port of XGS. Your monitor and video card must be able to run at
an 800x600 resolution with 8-bit pixels.

The Win32 port requires that the C:\XGS directory exist for storage
of the preferences file. Eventually this will be changed.

At startup, you will be given a dialog box with the ability to
change the path of the XGS directory (C:\XGS by default). This
directory is where XGS looks for the XGS.ROM, XGS.RAM, XGS40.FNT,
and XGS80.FNT files. You will also be able to select image files
to mount on each of the IIGS drives. The list of available images is
built by looking for all *.XGS files in the XGS directory, so you
should store your image files in this directory.

Keyboard support is mostly the same as the Unix version, with three
exceptions: the Escape key is mapped as F1, the Command key is mapped
as F3 and the Option key is mapped as F4. This is because Windows makes
it difficult to use the Alt and Escape keys (you can't easily tell Left
Alt from Right Alt, and many Alt and Escape key sequences are trapped
by the system).

Mouse support works just like the Unix version. That is, you toggle
between the Windows mouse and the IIGS mouse by pressing F6. While
in Windows mouse mode XGS does not pass through mouse movements or
button presses to the IIGS mouse.

Joystick support also works like the Unix version, with F5 toggling
between Windows mouse mode and the IIGS joystick. As with the mouse
emulation, while in Windows mouse mode XGS will not pass through
mouse movements or button presses to the IIGS joystick.

If you run into any problems, you can check the file BOOTLOG.TXT in the
same directory as the XGS.EXE executable. It contains all the startup
and shutdown messages produced by the emulator.
