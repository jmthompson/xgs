Documentation is located in the docs/ subdirectory in ASCII format.

If this is a beta version of XGS, _please_ read the BETANOTE.TXT file before
you do anything else. It will tell you what features are known not to work
in this release so that you don't report them as bugs when I already know
about them. :)
